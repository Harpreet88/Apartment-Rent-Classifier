## Project Overview

This project analyzes apartment rental data to explore rental prices based on various features like location, apartment size, amenities, and more. The project focuses on visualizing trends in rental prices using Power BI.
The main goal of this project is to explore apartment rents and uncover trends in rental prices based on various influencing factors. This involves:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering
Creating visualizations and dashboards in Power BI
Key Features
Spatial Analysis: Visualizing apartment rent trends on geographical maps in Power BI.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzing rental price trends over time.
Data Classification: Exploring the distribution of rental prices across various apartment features like size, location, and amenities.
Technologies Used
Power BI: Creating dashboards for analysis and visualizations.
Python: Data preprocessing and feature engineering (Pandas, NumPy).
SQL: Data querying for analysis.
Dataset
The dataset consists of apartment listings with features such as:

Rent price
Apartment size (in square feet)
Location (city, neighborhood)
Number of rooms
Amenities (e.g., pool, gym, parking)
Date of Listing
The dataset is used to analyze and visualize rent prices based on the available features.



# Insights

A single-page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

The following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;



## Filters 
### State Selector
### Number of Bedrooms Slicer
### Pets Friendly

## Results
### [1] Average price by Square feet
